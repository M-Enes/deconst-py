# deconst-py project

Simple **command line tool** for replace constant with value in **Python files**.

## Installing
Clone project with command:

`git clone https://github.com/M-Enes/deconst-py.git`

Then, enter the directory with `cd deconst-py`

Then, run this `./deconst.py`

**Congrats!** You set up deconst-py successfully, you can use it now with `deconst-py` on anywhere.

## Known Issues

*Currently, doesn't run stable with **multiline variables**.*

*Variable name cannot be defined as **containing another variable name**.*
